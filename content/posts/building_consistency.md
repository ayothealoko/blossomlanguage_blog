## Consistency is the first step to acheiving your goals

So for the last 45 days, I have been consistent with my German lessons.

I am very happy about it. I have tried many learning routines before but I always tap out after a week. This time though, I am doing it and I am seeing good results. So let me tell you what I changed.

## I used to use the wrong tools for me

Before, I would get a textbook, setup a notion page, download the top 500 flashcard deck and setup anki.

Whew!

After that, I would watch youtube videos for the best techniques. Sadly, none of this would help me be consistent. After a week, I would stop doing my lessons, stop reviewing my flashcards and loose all that initial momentum. I have done this more than 5 time now.

## I found a better routine and technique
45 days ago, I decided to do something new. I saw a video by [Proffessor  Arg√ºelles](https://youtu.be/MqR3K1alUio?si=3C_JgNBvL11lV2LX).

In the video, he outlines a method for language learning in under 15 minutes a day. I watch the video and took notes to use this method.
I mostly follow this method but it takes me around 90 minutes so 6 time longer. It might take you less. 

## My routine as of today
I use the asimil texbook like proffersors says. And listen to the audion on my laptop. Finally, I use pen and paper to take notes. No notion or any other digtal note taking apps.

This is what I do everyday for language learning

- I write the lession number and title on a new page in my book
- I listen to the audio once to get a feel for it
- I then listen to the audio and shadow (speak outloud following the speaker) the speaker 5 times
- I then listen to the audio and shadow while reading the english translation 5 times
- I then listen to the audio and shadow while reading the german text 5 times
- Ater I go over the lesson learning the grammar points (making sure to write down point in my book).
- Finally I answer the question and mark. Then correct the ones I got wrong.

In all this take about 90 minutes to do, not 15 minutes.
Also I dont pause or slow the audio. After a couple lessons, the speed wont be a problem.

## Why I think this new routine is helping

I think the biggest difference is having clear a  milestone. I want to finish asimil in a hundred days. This is milestone in my journey to learn German.

With Asimil, you can easily track your progress. This helps me stay motivated because I know every chapter is a step closer to my goal.

I hope this post will help you find a routine that works for you. That way to can become consistent too.
