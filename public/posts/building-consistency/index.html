<h2 id="the-old-way">The old way</h2>
<p>So I have currently been consistently learning german for the last 45 day and I am very happy about it. I have tried before but I ususally tap out at a week. This time thugh I was able to go consistenly bo my lesson and see good results from it. I want to talk about what changed and how it can help someone learning a new language.</p>
<p>So before, I would ge a textbook, setup a notion page, Plann out the duolingo chatpers and download the top 500 flashcard deck. After that I would watch youtube videos from evevryone under sun about what is the best techniques to learn a language. However I could never be consistent. After a week, I would stop doing my lessons, stop reviewing my flashcards and loose all that initial momentum. I have done this more than 5 time now.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-way">The new way</h2>
<p>45 days ago was different tho. I did something new. I saw a video by <a href="https://youtu.be/MqR3K1alUio?si=3C_JgNBvL11lV2LX">Proffessor  Arg√ºelles</a>. In the video he outline a method for language learning in 15 minutes a day. I mostly follow that method albeit it takes me around 90 minutes so 6 time longer. For this method I use the asimil texbook as in the video, my laptop for audio, and finally pen and paper for</p>
<p>This is what i do everyday for language learning</p>
<ul>
<li>I listen to the audio for passages audio</li>
<li>I then listen to the audio and shadow 5 times</li>
<li>I then listen to the audio and shadow while reading the english translation 5 times</li>
<li>I then listen to the audio and shadow while reading the german text 5 times</li>
<li>Ater I go over the lesson learning the grammar points (making sure to write down point in my book).</li>
<li>Finally I answer the question and mark. Then correct the ones I got wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all this take about 90 minutes to do, not 15 minutes.</p>
<p>What I think makes me stay consistent is that I want to finish all 100 lessons. Having such a concrete goal and knowing aproximately how much time I need to achieve my goal.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>No I am always half way there. Hopefully this time I get further, not just the 100 lesson but reach the goal of b1.</p>
