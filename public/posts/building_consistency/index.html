<h2 id="consistency-is-the-first-step-to-acheiving-your-goals">Consistency is the first step to acheiving your goals</h2>
<p>So for the last 45 days, I have been consistent with my German lessons.</p>
<p>I am very happy about it. I have tried many learning routines before but I always tap out after a week. This time though, I am doing it and I am seeing good results. So let me tell you what I changed.</p>
<h2 id="i-used-to-use-the-wrong-tools-for-me">I used to use the wrong tools for me</h2>
<p>Before, I would get a textbook, setup a notion page, download the top 500 flashcard deck and setup anki.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
<p>After that, I would watch youtube videos for the best techniques. Sadly, none of this would help me be consistent. After a week, I would stop doing my lessons, stop reviewing my flashcards and loose all that initial momentum. I have done this more than 5 time now.</p>
<h2 id="i-found-a-better-routine-and-technique">I found a better routine and technique</h2>
<p>45 days ago, I decided to do something new. I saw a video by <a href="https://youtu.be/MqR3K1alUio?si=3C_JgNBvL11lV2LX">Proffessor  Arg√ºelles</a>.</p>
<p>In the video, he outlines a method for language learning in under 15 minutes a day. I watch the video and took notes to use this method.
I mostly follow this method but it takes me around 90 minutes so 6 time longer. It might take you less.</p>
<h2 id="my-routine-as-of-today">My routine as of today</h2>
<p>I use the asimil texbook like proffersors says. And listen to the audion on my laptop. Finally, I use pen and paper to take notes. No notion or any other digtal note taking apps.</p>
<p>This is what I do everyday for language learning</p>
<ul>
<li>I write the lession number and title on a new page in my book</li>
<li>I listen to the audio once to get a feel for it</li>
<li>I then listen to the audio and shadow (speak outloud following the speaker) the speaker 5 times</li>
<li>I then listen to the audio and shadow while reading the english translation 5 times</li>
<li>I then listen to the audio and shadow while reading the german text 5 times</li>
<li>Ater I go over the lesson learning the grammar points (making sure to write down point in my book).</li>
<li>Finally I answer the question and mark. Then correct the ones I got wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all this take about 90 minutes to do, not 15 minutes.
Also I dont pause or slow the audio. After a couple lessons, the speed wont be a problem.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-think-this-new-routine-is-helping">Why I think this new routine is helping</h2>
<p>I think the biggest difference is having clear a  milestone. I want to finish asimil in a hundred days. This is milestone in my journey to learn German.</p>
<p>With Asimil, you can easily track your progress. This helps me stay motivated because I know every chapter is a step closer to my goal.</p>
<p>I hope this post will help you find a routine that works for you. That way to can become consistent too.</p>
