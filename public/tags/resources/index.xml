      <description>Photo by Magda Ehlers&#xA;The old way So I have currently been consistently learning german for the last 45 day and I am very happy about it. I have tried before but I ususally tap out at a week. This time thugh I was able to go consistenly bo my lesson and see good results from it. I want to talk about what changed and how it can help someone learning a new language.</description>
